Senior Care Lite is a modern as well as a sophisticated theme for senior citizens, shelter homes, elderly care centers, old age homes, etc. You can use it as a multipurpose theme for orphanages, non-profits, charity works, fundraisers, for running NGO campaigns, donation camps, and more. A user-friendly interface is so much useful for bringing a professional design that anyone can use. It is designed with elegance and a minimal approach to focus on primary information. The clean layout highlights the information and its responsive design makes it fit every screen size. You will find the testimonial section, a beautiful banner, team, and other sections along with many personalization options. The SEO-friendly design will get you traffic and the highly optimized codes will deliver faster page load time.  Bootstrap framework is used for making the design interactive and Call to Action Buttons (CTA) placed on the homepage will give you better conversion rates. Translation-ready options are provided with the theme.
